## Vercel background and general information


Industry :Frontend cloud platform​
Founded: 2015​
Headquarters: San Francisco, California​
Country/Territory: United States​
CEO: Guillermo Rauch​
Employees: 600​
Argentinian immigrant Guillermo Rauch taught himself English and software engineering at age 11 by reading software manuals. Vercel, his latest startup, allows web developers to focus on the frontend without worrying about backend servers. The company is predicated on Next.js, an open-source Web development framework Rauch authored which is actively used by over two million developers monthly at companies like Hulu, Nike and Target. Founded in 2015, the San Francisco-based company has raised $563 million, closing an Accel-led $250 million Series E funding round at a $3.25 billion valuation last year. Vercel, achieved $200M in annual recurring revenue in May with customers including Cox Enterprises, Cursor, OpenAI, Runway and Zapier. In August, the company debuted its agentic v0.app, which can “think, plan and take actions autonomously.” A previous version of that app was used by hackers to create phishing sites that looked like legit login pages, Axios reported in July. The company has since restricted access to those sites. ​

## React

- JavaScript library which is traditionally used to build web applications that are rendered in the clients browser. 




## Why does next.js exist? 

React alone only handles the UI layer​
Traditional React apps load slowly & struggle with SEO​
Developers had to configure routing, SSR, and optimization manually​
